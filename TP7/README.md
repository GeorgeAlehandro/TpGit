# TP7 - Databases + MVC

## Introduction

This exercise was done in the context of a practical exercise around MVC programming architecture. We are building a phone book.  
_To know more about MVC:_

## Main goals
- Create a Phone Book similar to TP6, but using a MySQL database as a model instead of a dictionary.  


## Requirements
To run this test, python3 is needed to be installed along with the packages mentioned inside including _mysql.connector_.  
MySQL and phpmyadmin configurations should be done in the local machine.  
A databased named 'tp7' must be created inside localhost/phpmyadmin before running the script.  
All the files should be in the same directory.


## About main.py
To run the program, we should call
```bash
python3 main.py -h
```
With -h all the possible arguments will be shown, including:
```bash
python3 main.py -g
```
which directly runs the GUI mode on tkinter.
## To run the script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeorgeAlehandro/TpGit/
python3 TpGit/TP7/main.py -h
```
