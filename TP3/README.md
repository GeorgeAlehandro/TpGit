## Introduction

This exercice was done in the context of a practical exercice around object oriented programming on python.

- Manipulate the chained list by deleting elements.
- Make the chained list itterable.

## Secondary goals
- Added other functions to get used to creating methods for a class.  
- Small comparisons between randomly generated list and chained_list and observe the time each operation takes.
## Requirements
