# TP3 - INLO

## Introduction

This exercice was done in the context of a practical exercice around object oriented programming in python. 

## Main goal
- Create a chained list based on the consecutive insertion of nodes in a sorted way.  
- Manipulate the chained list by deleting elements.
- Make the chained list itterable.

## Secondary goals
- Added other functions to get used to creating methods for a class.  
- Small comparisons between randomly generated list and chained_list and observe the time each operation takes.
## Requirements
To run this test, python3 is needed to be installed along with the packages mentioned inside.  
The file chained_list.py needs to be on the same directory as the main.py.


## Input
Floats and integers are accepted by using the add_node() method.
_Please refer to the function list_to_chained_list(input_list) if you want to use a list as an input for a Chained List.

## Output
A chained list will be obtained.
## Optional methods:
### - add_first_node(value)
### - add_last_node(value)
### - length()
### - get(index)
### - delete(index)
### - delete_node(value)
## Optional functions
### - random_gen(number):  
which calls chainedlist_gen(number), list_gen(number).  
Out of curiosity to find the difference in time between an operation on lists VS chained lists.  
### - list_to_chained_list(input_list):  
Transorms an object of instance list into a Chained List.
