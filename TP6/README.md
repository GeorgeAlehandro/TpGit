# TP6 - MVC

## Introduction

This exercise was done in the context of a practical exercise around MVC programming architecture. We are building a phone book.
_To know more about MVC:_

## Main goals
- Implement all the needed files, classes, methods to create a Phone Book.
- Each person should be indexed by his name.

## Secondary goals
- The files can be saved by using the pickle package.
- Integrate a cli view beside the tkinter one.
## Requirements
To run this test, python3 is needed to be installed along with the packages mentioned inside including _ttkwidgets_.
```bash
pip install ttkwidgets
```
All the files should be in the directory.


## About main.py
To run the program, we should call
```bash
python3 main.py -h
```
With -h all the possible arguments will be shown, including:
```bash
python3 main.py -g
```
which directly runs the GUI mode on tkinter.
## To run the script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeorgeAlehandro/TpGit/
python3 TpGit/TP6/main.py
```
